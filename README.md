>In Arcane the ***use of colors*** and how they can change a scene is fascinating. Colors are used in a very *expressive* way to express the drama of a scene ([Arcane image 1](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/1008243435341627746/) ) or to characterize specific places in the setting, ([Arcane image 2](https://it.pinterest.com/pin/402861129190891341/)). In the series we are shown this bar  "The Last Drop" in various contexts, it changes along with the plot and it is fascinating to see how in these two scenes ([Arcane image 3](https://it.pinterest.com/pin/427982770857075007/), [Arcane image 4](https://it.pinterest.com/pin/362047257566218432/)) this bar changes drastically, depending on how events go. For this series they use **3D** characters on a **2D** background but the difference is not that noticeable due to the ***texture*** used on the 3D model.

## Cooding Technique Exploration:

>For the background texture I could use this technique of [painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEYdsoZua7E). There are various techniques and pieces of code that I could use to create [3D elements](), thay can  have the same texture as the background, so that they are not too detached. Finally you could use the mouse or keyboard to interact and [change color of the scenary](https://editor.p5js.org/ivymeadows/sketches/B1PpMXlsZ)
