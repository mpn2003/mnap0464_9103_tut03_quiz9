>In Arcane the ***use of colors*** and how they can change a scene is fascinating. Colors are used in a very *expressive* way to express the drama of a scene ([Arcane image 1](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/1008243435341627746/) ) or to characterize specific places in the setting, ([Arcane image 2](https://it.pinterest.com/pin/402861129190891341/)). In the series we are shown this bar  "The Last Drop" in various contexts, it changes along with the plot and it is fascinating to see how in these two scenes ([Arcane image 3](https://it.pinterest.com/pin/427982770857075007/),
[Arcane image 4](https://it.pinterest.com/pin/362047257566218432/)) this bar changes drastically, depending on how events go. For this series they use **3D** characters on a **2D** background but the difference is not that noticeable due to the ***texture*** used on the 3D model.

## Cooding Technique Exploration




>For the background I could use this technique of [painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEYdsoZua7E) for the background texture. There are various techniques and pieces of code that I could use to create 3D elements, thay can  have the same texture as the background, so that they are not too detached. Finally you could use the mouse or keyboard to interact and [change color of the scenary](https://editor.p5js.org/ivymeadows/sketches/B1PpMXlsZ)
